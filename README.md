PlayerSelection is a simple Java program for the Ashesi Premier League that collects details about a football player and evaluates them based on different criteria such as age, weight, jersey number, and playing position. The program simulates a basic selection process to decide whether the player should play, rest, start in the lineup, or sit on the bench.
